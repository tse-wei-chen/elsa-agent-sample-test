# Run the server

If you use VS Code, press `F5` to start the server.

Or run it from PowerShell / the command line:

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\ElsaServer
```

After the server starts, open the studio in your browser:

- `https://localhost:5001` (HTTPS)

That's all — kept simple and minimal.
